# Phase 5: Portfolio Reconstruction COMPLETE 🏗️

I have overhauled the architecture to align with "Senior Frontend Architect" standards, prioritizing clean layout, system performance, and a focused user experience.

## Key Changes Deployed
- **Hero Section**: Removed the 3D cube entirely. The Hero is now a **Full-Screen Flex Center** layout (`height: 100vh`) with a subtle **Mesh Gradient** background that follows the mouse.
- **Vertical Timeline**: Replaced the list view in `experience.html` with a **Vertical Interactive Timeline** featuring central nodes and glassmorphic cards that animate on scroll.
- **Bento Grid**: Structured Honors & Volunteering in `about.html` into a modular **Bento Grid** with interactive hover effects.
- **Project Focus System**: Centralized modal logic in `script.js` (using a `contentMap`) to dynamically populate project details. The modal now features a **3D-effect placeholder image** and triggers a heavy **20px background blur**.
- **Global Design**: Implemented a **Sticky Frosted Header** and reverted to the native system cursor for precision.
